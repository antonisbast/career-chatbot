I'm Antonios Bastoulis, a naval architect and marine engineer transitioning into AI/ML engineering. What drives this career change is the realization that my engineering background—solving complex technical problems in regulated environments, working with data-driven systems, and delivering production-ready solutions—aligns perfectly with what modern AI/ML roles require. Unlike many who enter this field purely from academic routes, I bring a production mindset: I think about scalability, reliability, and real-world deployment from day one. My experience in marine surveying and fleet management taught me to work with imperfect data, manage stakeholder expectations, and deliver results under pressure—skills that translate directly to building robust AI systems. I left a stable position at ABS in February 2025 to fully commit to this transition, enrolling in a Master's in AI and Deep Learning while simultaneously building hands-on expertise in the hottest 2025 technologies: RAG systems, AI agents, LangChain, and LLM fine-tuning.
 I'm focusing on the intersection of cutting-edge AI (LLMs, transformers, generative AI) with engineering discipline (robust systems, proper documentation, production deployment). My domain expertise in maritime  also opens opportunities for specialized AI applications where others lack context. I'm targeting AI Engineer roles where I can work on LLM applications, intelligent agents, and RAG systems, but I'm pragmatic about starting as an ML Engineer or Data Scientist if that's the right stepping stone. By mid-2026, when I graduate, I'll have a Master's degree.
